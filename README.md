This is a timezone tracker flutter project.

I wanted to display my ability for being able to store data locally using shared preferences, and to use custom animated widgets with a clock ticking.

This app has two features. The first one is to keep track of different timezones that the user has favorited.

The other feature is the user is able to convert different timezones.
